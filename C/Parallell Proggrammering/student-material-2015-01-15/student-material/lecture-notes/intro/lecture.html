How to introduce yourself personally to every class mate?

<p>
Introduce the concept of a parallel algorithm.

<p>
Let the students come up with a parallel algorithm for systematic
pairwise introductions. Have them describe the algorithm to the class
and then execute it. Let them introduce themselves with their name,
age, where they grew up, and one fact about themselves not related to
school.

The course is 7.5 credits and <i>not</i> split in two parts unlike many

in your diploma.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-6">
<p>
The problem is that of renovating an entire apartment building.
</p>

<p>
<b>Sequential</b> computing is like doing it yourself.
</p>

<p>
<b>Parallel</b> computing is like doing it with your friends.
</p>

<p>
<b>Perfectly parallel</b> would the problem be if each friend renovated a
different apartment building. Since everyone works on a different
building there would be no need to synchronize or communicate.
</p>

<p>
A more interesting parallel problem is when you only renovate one
building and therefore have to coordinate your work. The more friends,
the more challenging the coordination becomes. Ten friends are much
easier to keep track of than 100 or 1000.
</p>

<p>
To divide the work between the group of friends, it is necessary to
decompose the problem into distinct tasks, each performed by one
person. This is called <b>task decomposition</b>.
</p>

<p>
A task could be big as in <i>renovate apartment 101</i> or small as in
<i>paint the bathroom ceiling in apartment 101</i>. This is the <b>task
granularity</b>.
</p>

<p>
The more tasks the more <b>parallelism</b>.
</p>

<p>
But the smaller the tasks the less efficient they will be to
execute. This is a very important point that makes parallel
programming more complicated. Compare moving one bucket of paint
across a room two times (two small tasks) versus moving two buckets of
paint at once (one big task). While you move a bit slower carrying two
buckets, you probably move the paint faster this way, meaning that the
bigger task is more efficient to execute.
</p>

<p>
Hence, we don't want <b>too few tasks</b> since then we don't get enough
work to keep all friends busy. But at the same time we also don't want
<b>too many tasks</b> since they will then become inefficient to execute,
slowing the whole process down even though everyone appears to be
busy.
</p>

<p>
The "right" <b>task granularity</b> (size of the tasks) is therefore
related to the number of friends. Few friends, big tasks. Many
friends, small tasks.
</p>

<p>
Tasks often cannot be performed in any order you like. Tasks are
<b>dependent</b> on each other. One task must finish before another can
start. You can't paint the wall before you have moved the furniture.
This is a <b>precedence constraint</b>. Finding the set of dependencies is
called <b>dependence analysis</b>.
</p>

<p>
The tasks and their dependencies can be expressed by a graph. A
<b>directed acyclic graph</b> (DAG), to be precise. The nodes are the
task. The edges are the dependencies. Edge from A to B means A must
finish before B starts. This is a <b>task graph</b>.
</p>

<p>
With our task graph in hand, we must decide <b>who does what and when</b>.
This is <b>scheduling</b>. The <b>schedule</b> (list of who does what and when)
must respect the dependencies expressed by the task graph.
</p>

<p>
There are <b>shared resources</b> such as elevators. Access to the elevator
needs to be <b>synchronized</b> causing <b>idle</b> friends waiting for the
elevator and doing nothing productive. This is one source of <b>parallel
overhead</b> and one of the reasons why you will not go 10 times faster
just by being 10 friends sharing the work.
</p>

<p>
There is <b>communication</b> (not the verbal kind) when the one who takes
the furniture down to ground level hands it over to the one driving
the truck to the furniture repair shop. Communication takes time and
is another source of parallel overhead.

<h3 id="sec-3-7">Describe the examination (10 min @ 30)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-7">
<p>
To pass the course you need to complete:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>5 labs (3 programming, 1 experimentation/writing, 1 reading/writing)
</li>
<li>1 exam (4 hours)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you fail an exam then there are two more chances scheduled this year.
</p>

<p>
If you fail a lab, then there is another deadline shortly after. If
you fail that one too, then there is a final chance in August. 
</p>

<p>
If you fail the course then you have to retake the course next year.
Completed assignments/exams may or may not carry over (assume that
they are not). It is up to the teacher next year to determine on a
case by case basis.

Influenced by learner-centered teaching philosophy.  Lectures do not
cover material. For that you mainly read a book.
</p>

<p>
Lectures are there to process information and promote deep learning.
</p>

<p>
For this to work, you need to be active and responsible. In
particular, bring pen and paper to every lecture and tell us if you
are unhappy with anything <i>before</i> the course ends so we can try to
fix it.
