    <string name="help_text">Rule 1: Each turn begins with
         you rolling all 6 dices until a minimum of 300 points is scored.\n\n
	     Rule 2: After passing 300 points, you may choose
	     to stop and take the points or stay greedy and keep rolling.\n\n
	     Rule 3: After each roll, a scoring dice must be
	     set aside. If you continue to roll, there are fewer dice and a
	     greater risk of failing to score and losing points.\n\nRule 4:
	     If no scoring dice are rolled, youÂ´re turn is over and
	     all points accumulated on that turn are lost.\n\n
	     Rule 5: Scoring dice from different rolls cannot be combined.\n\n
	     Rule 6: If you get all dices are used to give score you can either save and 
	     begin a new turn or choose to throw again to try and get more score.  
	     \n\nRule 7: Once you passes 10.000 points you have won.\n\n
	     Dice rolls are scored as follows:\n
	     * Three of a kind of every dice is worth  100 time the value of the dice,
	     except ones which are worth 1 000 points.\n
	     * Single ones are worth 100 and single fives 50 points.\n
	     * Straight is 1 000 points</string>
